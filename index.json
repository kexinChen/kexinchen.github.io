Neurons in monkey area MSTd respond to complex optic flow patterns resulting from self-motion. We developed a spiking neural network model that showed MSTd-like response properties can emerge from evolving spike-timing-dependent plasticity with STDP-H parameters of the connections between then middle temporal area and MSTd. Simulated MSTd neurons formed a sparse, reduced population code capable of encoding perceptual variables important for self-motion perception. This model demonstrates that complex neuronal responses observed in MSTd may emerge from efficient coding and suggests that neurobiological plasticity, like STDP-H, may contribute to reducing the dimensions of input stimuli and allowing spiking neurons to learn sparse representations.","tags":null,"title":"Cortical Motion Perception Emerges from Dimensionality Reduction with Evolved Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity Rules","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658016000,"objectID":"3d8e1be7d1001b52912850ef428deacf","permalink":"https://kexinchenn.github.io/publication/carlsim6/","publishdate":"2022-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carlsim6/","section":"publication","summary":" Mature simulation systems for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) become more relevant than ever for understanding the brain and supporting neuromorphic computing. The CARL-sim SNN platform is one of the first Open Source simulation systems that utilized CUDA GPUs to address the tremendous parallel processing demands of natural brains. It has evolved over almost a decade in numerous scientific research projects requiring efficient biologically plausible modeling at scale. With its sixth major release, CARLsim 6 respects this legacy by supporting the latest versions of operating systems, development tool chains, multi-core computers, and of course GPUs. It runs on a range of platforms; from Notebooks up to the NVIDIA DGX-A100 supercomputer, and is used in biologically plausible simulations of the hippocampus and neocortex. The latest version has added flexibility for incorporating long-term and short-term synaptic plasticity. Neuromodulation is an important property of neurobiology that can lead to rapid few shot learning, network rewiring, and neural activity modulation. Because of this, CARLsim 6 now supports four multiple neuromodulators for simulating neural excitability and synaptic plasticity.","tags":null,"title":"Large-Scale, Biologically Detailed Spiking Neural Network Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626739200,"objectID":"4545ce02674a7d9a1d28c86f0546ab96","permalink":"https://kexinchenn.github.io/publication/ca1_sub_ijcnn2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ca1_sub_ijcnn2021/","section":"publication","summary":" Differential Spatial Representations in Hippocampal CA1 and Subiculum Emerge in Evolved Spiking Neural Networks. [Paper](../../files/ijcnn2021.pdf) published in the 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) Proceedings. In rodent navigational studies, spatial responses have been identified in both the hippocampal subregion CA1 and the subiculum (SUB), but these two brain regions appear to encode spatial features differently. Place fields of SUB place cells are larger and less specific than CA1. Additionally, SUB neurons exhibit stronger directional modulation for heading and axes of travel. Based on neural and behavioral data recorded as rats perform a navigational task on a \"triple-T\" maze, we present a spiking neural network modeling framework to replicate response properties observed in the CA1 and SUB. The parameters of Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity and homeostatic scaling (STDP-H) were evolved such that the response of the two different SNNs resembled recordings from CA1 and SUB when rats traversed the triple-T maze. Our results suggest that positional input may be more influential in forming CA1 place cells, while the SUB appears to integrate both allocentric positional information and self-motion cues to encode \"kinds of places\". Furthermore, our results predict that the different spatial responses in these regions may be due in part to different STDP-H learning parameters. The framework presented here could be used as an automated parameter tuning system for replicating responses in other brain regions.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Spatial Cognition Components with Spiking Neural Networks","type":"publication"}]
